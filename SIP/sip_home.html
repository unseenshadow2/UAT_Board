		<h2>What is Operation: Red Rhino?</h2>
		
		Operation: Red Rhino is an prototype implementation of a player directed session progression system
		developed in Unreal Engine 4 using Blueprint and C++. The progression system allows the players to 
		choose the next locale, each with its own objective. Each locale that a team owns provides the team
		with rewards specific to the locale.
		
		<h2>Why is this Important?</h2>
		
		The implementation of a player directed session progression system provides a platform for the
		system to be mimicked in future video games. The system itself allows individual multiplayer match to
		feel important to the players, increasing replayability, as each choice of locale within a session 
		provides the winning team with a specific benefit.
