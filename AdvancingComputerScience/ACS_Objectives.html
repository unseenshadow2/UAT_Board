	<h3>Java 2 Final Project</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		This project displays that I have met objective two by using the programming language Java and the Java IDE
		IntelliJ. While I normally work within C++ and C#, the final project of Java 2 required not only understanding
		how classes work in Java, but also how Java handles Graphic User Interfaces.<br/><br/>

		This project displays that I have met objective two by displaying my comfort and familiarity with the 
		basic three web programming languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and Notepad++ as a development environment.
		HTML and CSS handle the visual aspect of the board, while JavaScript is used to load HTML files into the
		body of the board without leaving the main page.<br/><br/>
