<h1>Advancing Computer Science Objectives</h1>

<h2>
	Objective 1:<br/>
	Follow a software development process to analyse a problem, and to design, build and test software solutions.
</h2>

	<p class="objective_text">
		Mettle RPG Assistant started as a simple problem: The tools that exist for managing table top role playing games
		either don't support more than one system or only support a limited set of systems. The team for Mettle set out to
		design and build a software solution that could handle any system by providing users with a universal set of tools
		and the ability to create the various sheets/forms that their chosen system uses.<br/><br/>

<h2>
	Objective 2:<br/>
	Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming language and development environment.

	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		This project displays that I have met objective two by using the programming language Java and the Java IDE
		IntelliJ. While I normally work within C++ and C#, the final project of Java 2 required not only understanding
		how classes work in Java, but also how Java handles Graphic User Interfaces.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Blade Runner Training Simulator</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		Created in C# using Visual Studio 2017, the Blade Runner Training Simulator is as simple as it looks. However,
		it serves to display that I am proficient with C#, multiple project interaction in Visual Studio, and WinForms,
		C#'s default graphic user interface library.<br/><br/>

	<p class="objective_text">
		Websites are outstanding projects for multiple reasons, one of them being the fact that they support multiple
		operating systems by default. My board website is no exception. Whether Unix or Mac or Windows, my board functions
		the same across the various platforms and even handles multiple screen sizes with ease.<br/><br/>

		Mettle RPG Assistant may no longer be up and running, but it is an outstanding example of pre-planning. The project
		started with just a project proposal and only expanded from there on. Quickly we had to determine how our database
		was going to be structured as well as what our graphic user interface would need to look like. At the end of the
		project, we even added a user guide.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Operation: Red Rhino</h3>
	<p class="objective_text">
		Operation: Red Rhino (ORR) is a video game created in the Unreal Game Engine, a game engine that was created for triple A
		video games and has been an industry standard since. SCRUM was the primary method for organization of the team during my
		contribution with git to handle version control of the project.<br/><br/>
