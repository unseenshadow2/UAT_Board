</h2>
<p>
	<h3>Mettle RPG Assistant</h3>

	<p class="objective_text">
		Mettle RPG Assistant started as a simple problem: The tools that exist for managing table top role playing games
		either don't support more than one system or only support a limited set of systems. The team for Mettle set out to
		design and build a software solution that could handle any system by providing users with a universal set of tools
		and the ability to create the various sheets/forms that their chosen system uses.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Stars Without Number Planet Manager</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		As a consistent game master for a table top role playing game called Stars Without Number, I found keeping track
		of one particular thing to be both tedious and important: Planets. This prompted me to build and test the Stars
		Without Number Planet Manager.<br/><br/>

<h2>
	Objective 2:<br/>
	Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming language and development environment.
</h2>
<p>
	<h3>Java 2 Final Project</h3>

	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		This project displays that I have met objective two by using the programming language Java and the Java IDE
		IntelliJ. While I normally work within C++ and C#, the final project of Java 2 required not only understanding
		how classes work in Java, but also how Java handles Graphic User Interfaces.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Blade Runner Training Simulator</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		Created in C# using Visual Studio 2017, the Blade Runner Training Simulator is as simple as it looks. However,
		it serves to display that I am proficient with C#, multiple project interaction in Visual Studio, and WinForms,
		C#'s default graphic user interface library.<br/><br/>

	<p class="objective_text">
		Websites are outstanding projects for multiple reasons, one of them being the fact that they support multiple
		operating systems by default. My board website is no exception. Whether Unix or Mac or Windows, my board functions
		the same across the various platforms and even handles multiple screen sizes with ease.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Stars Without Number Planet Manager</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		The Stars Without Number Planet Manager is a program for Windows or a Webforms web page designed to aid game masters
		of the table top role playing game Stars Without Number in storing information on planets. This project meets objective
		3 by having both a native windows program and a response website (which functions for nearly any device with a web browser).<br/><br/>

	<p class="objective_text">
		The Serial Piano is a program for an Arduino Uno that takes in a series of characters from the serial port and converts
		it into a song and plays that over an attached speaker. This simple program displays an understanding of connecting electronics
		and interfacing them with Arduinos and possibly other embedded systems.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Higher Lower Fire Smoke</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		A android adaptation of the card game Higher Lower Fire Smoke, this project provides an easy way to slow down and enjoy
		a few moments of free time. It was built in the Unity Game Engine with Visual Studio.<br/><br/>

	<p class="objective_text">
		Mettle RPG Assistant may no longer be up and running, but it is an outstanding example of pre-planning. The project
		started with just a project proposal and only expanded from there on. Quickly we had to determine how our database
		was going to be structured as well as what our graphic user interface would need to look like. At the end of the
		project, we even added a user guide.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Operation: Red Rhino</h3>
	<p class="objective_text">
		Operation: Red Rhino (ORR) is a video game created in the Unreal Game Engine, a game engine that was created for triple A
		video games and has been an industry standard since. SCRUM was the primary method for organization of the team during my
		contribution with git to handle version control of the project.<br/><br/>

	<p class="objective_text">
		This project meets objective 6 by implementing a queue in c++. While simple, the project displays my understanding of data
		structures to the point that I am able to write my own without any external libraries.<br/><br/>
