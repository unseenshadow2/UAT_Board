		This web page is the Portfolio Board for Anthony Parsch as required to graduate from the <a href="http://www.uat.edu">University of Advancing Technology</a> (UAT).
		UAT requires that all students meet six objectives for each of their bachelor's degrees with at least two projects from their academic careers. This board
		will go over the six objectives for Video Game Programming and Advancing Computer Science as well as the projects I have completed during my academic career which
		meet the objectives.
