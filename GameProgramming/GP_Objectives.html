<h1>Game Programming Objectives</h1>
<h2>
	Objective 1:<br/>
	Implement multiple completed games, including 3D games, using common tools, languages, and software for web, console, PC or mobile platforms.
</h2>
<p>
	<h3>Knick Knax</h3> 
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		Knick Knax was probably my first completed game. I remember working on it with Trevor, Donald, and Molly on the 
		original game jam version of Knick Knax as well as with the Terrasect team when Knick Knax moved on to be a Game
		Production Studio game.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Shepard's Pie</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		A game jam game that was brought to a functional/minimum completion build. While it hasn't been worked on since,
		it uses several good assets made by Molly.<br/><br/>

<h2>
	Objective 2:<br/>
	Design, develop and implement the architecture and infrastructure needed to support a complete game project.
</h2>
<p>
	<h3>UATanks</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		UATanks may not be the prettiest game, but it does include basic AI, procedural generation, and pickups,
		on top of the basics like movement and shooting.<br/><br/>

	</p>
	
	<h3>Artillery Game</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		Artillery Game is a game about moving around and bombarding enemies from a distance with a weapon whose arc is important to consider. The
		game features a marker for where the shot will land and its area of effect as well as a turret that has vertical and horizontal rotation.<br/><br/>

</p>

<h2>
	Objective 3:<br/>
	Implement and analyse fundamental data structures and algorithms associated with game applications supporting gameplay mechanics.
</h2>
<p>
	<h3>Knick Knax</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		In Knick Knax, one of the core mechanics, magnets, required the use of a list in order to store what items were
		connected to the magnet. Connecting to magnets the basis of most of the items in Knick Knax.<br/><br/>

	<h3>UATanks</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		UATanks has a pickup system integrated into it. This system relies on a list to handle storing all of the active effects.<br/><br/>

<h2>
	Objective 4:<br/>
	Use software development processes to analyse a project problem, and to design, build and test a corresponding software solution.
</h2>
<p>
	<h3>Mettle RPG Assistant</h3>

	<p class="objective_text">
		Mettle RPG Assistant started as a simple problem: The tools that exist for managing table top role playing games
		either don't support more than one system or only support a limited set of systems. The team for Mettle set out to
		design and build a software solution that could handle any system by providing users with a universal set of tools
		and the ability to create the various sheets/forms that their chosen system uses.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Stars Without Number Planet Manager</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		As a consistent game master for a table top role playing game called Stars Without Number, I found keeping track
		of one particular thing to be both tedious and important: Planets. This prompted me to build and test the Stars
		Without Number Planet Manager.<br/><br/>

<h2>
	Objective 5:<br/>
	Demonstrate development skills using multiple programming languages, development environments, and platforms, including advanced and/or experimental topics in game programming.
</h2>

	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		While most of the game programming work at UAT happens in Unity, C#, and Visual Studio, at the end of Java 2 I made a
		simple button controlled text fighting game. This was done in Java and IntelliJ, requiring the ability to work with Java's
		graphic user interface programming.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Resourse_Wars_Chaos_Begins</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
		While the function of Resource Wars: Chaos Begins is a relatively simple project in terms of functionality, just
		buttons that display randomly generated numbers, it does this with C#'s asynchronous TCP library and a custom C#
		TCP server.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Higher Lower Fire Smoke</h3>
	<p class="objective_text" style="padding-right: 15px">
